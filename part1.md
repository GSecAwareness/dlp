# 🔐 Introduction to Data Loss Prevention (DLP) in Microsoft Purview

## 🛡️ Protecting Sensitive Information

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) in Microsoft Purview is a strategy designed to safeguard sensitive information, such as financial records, health data, and personal identifiers, from oversharing or unauthorized exposure. For example, you can set up policies to help ensure information in emails and documents isn’t shared with the wrong person. 

By establishing DLP policies, organizations can identify, monitor, and protect sensitive data across various platforms, including Microsoft 365 services and applications. This applies to many apps like Word, OneDrive, and SharePoint. 

## 🔎 How DLP Works

These policies utilize deep content analysis techniques like:

- **Keyword matching**  
- **Regular expressions**  
- **Function validation**  
- **Machine learning algorithms**  

These techniques help detect sensitive information more accurately. When a potential incident is identified, DLP can take protective actions such as:

- Displaying policy tips to users  
- Blocking sharing attempts  
- Quarantining sensitive items  

## 🏷️ Sensitivity Labels & DLP

One of the easiest ways to utilize DLP is through sensitivity labels, which apply classification and protection rules to files automatically.
